# fcose

A framework-independent, pure Dart port of
[`cytoscape-fcose`](https://github.com/iVis-at-Bilkent/cytoscape.js-fcose)
2.2.0 and its required `cose-base` and `layout-base` foundations.

The package accepts a typed compound graph and returns deterministic node
centers and rectangles. It has no Cytoscape.js, browser, Flutter, FFI, or
JavaScript runtime dependency, and no package dependencies at all. Layout hot
paths use compact packing structures and reduced allocation; see
[Performance versus upstream](#performance-versus-upstream) for measured
comparisons against cytoscape-fcose.

Layouts are reproducible: the same graph, options, and `seed` produce the same
coordinates on the Dart VM and on dart2js.

## Install

```sh
dart pub add fcose:^0.1.0
```

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:fcose/fcose.dart';

final graph = FcoseGraph(
  nodes: const [
    FcoseNode(id: 'cluster'),
    FcoseNode(id: 'api', width: 72, height: 48, parentId: 'cluster'),
    FcoseNode(id: 'database', width: 72, height: 48, parentId: 'cluster'),
    FcoseNode(id: 'client', width: 72, height: 48),
  ],
  edges: const [
    FcoseEdge(
      id: 'request',
      source: 'client',
      target: 'api',
      idealLength: 80,
    ),
    FcoseEdge(
      id: 'query',
      source: 'api',
      target: 'database',
      idealLength: 80,
    ),
  ],
);

final result = FcoseLayout(
  options: const FcoseOptions(
    quality: LayoutQuality.proof,
    seed: 7,
    idealEdgeLength: 80,
  ),
).run(graph);

final apiCenter = result.positionOf('api');
final clusterBounds = result.rectOf('cluster');
final everything = result.boundsOf(['api', 'database', 'client']);
```

`FcoseResult` carries `positions` and `rectangles` for every node, compounds
included, plus the `iterations` the spring embedder actually ran.
`positionOf`, `rectOf`, and `boundsOf` throw on an unknown ID rather than
returning null.

### Semantics worth knowing before the first run

- Node `width` and `height` are measured layout dimensions; the layout never
  resizes a node, it only places it.
- Edge ideal lengths are boundary-to-boundary distances, as in CoSE, not
  center-to-center distances.
- With `randomize: false` every leaf node must carry an initial position;
  the layout refines what it is given instead of inventing a start.
- A compound node's rectangle is derived bottom-up from its children plus
  `compoundPadding`; giving one a width and height does not pin its size.
- Scalar force defaults can be replaced with typed per-element resolvers:
  `nodeRepulsionFor`, `idealEdgeLengthFor`, `edgeElasticityFor`, and the two
  tiling-padding resolvers. Each is evaluated once per layout run, and an
  explicit value on `FcoseNode` or `FcoseEdge` wins over a resolver.

### Constraints

```dart
const FcoseOptions(
  fixedNodes: [FixedNodeConstraint('client', Offset(0, 0))],
  alignment: AlignmentConstraint(vertical: [['api', 'database']]),
  relativePlacements: [
    RelativePlacementConstraint.vertical('api', 'database', gap: 120),
  ],
);
```

`vertical` alignment means a shared x coordinate, `horizontal` a shared y. An
omitted `gap` follows upstream and resolves to the average ideal edge length
plus half of each endpoint's size on the constrained axis. As upstream does,
any constraint disables zero-degree tiling and component packing for the run.

## Performance versus upstream

Wall times below compare an AOT Dart binary (`dart compile exe`) to
cytoscape-fcose 2.2.0 under Node.js on the same 800-node grid
(`quality: proof`, packing and tiling off, seed 7). Use AOT for this kind of
comparison: `dart run` is a JIT session and understates the port on long
spring runs.

| Workload | Dart AOT | cytoscape-fcose 2.2.0 | Speedup |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Common path — `randomize: true`, ~100 spring ticks | 37 ms | 105 ms | 2.8× |
| Long CoSE — `randomize: false`, `step: cose`, identical starts, 2900 ticks | 1295 ms | 2078 ms | 1.6× |

The long-path row feeds both sides the same leaf coordinates so each runs the
same tick count; a different start PRNG can stop early and is not comparable.
Measured on macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon) with Node v26.

Reproduce:

```sh
dart compile exe -o /tmp/fcose_bench tool/bench_layout.dart
/tmp/fcose_bench
cd tool/oracle && npm install && node bench.js
```

`tool/bench_layout.dart` times the Dart side; `tool/oracle/bench.js` times the
upstream layout. For a tick-matched long run, share one position dump between
them rather than regenerating starts independently.

## Parity with upstream

Parity with cytoscape-fcose is this port's primary design constraint, and it
is measured rather than asserted. The repository carries a differential
harness that runs the original JavaScript under headless Cytoscape on the same
fixture and diffs the coordinates:

```sh
cd tool/oracle && npm install
dart run tool/parity.dart tool/oracle/specs/*.json --tolerance 0.5
```

24 fixtures cover unconstrained, constrained, randomized, draft, compound,
tiled, and packed runs. 23 agree with upstream to about 1e-13; the 24th is a
known upstream defect, described below. The suite also pins those coordinates
as expectations in `test/fcose_test.dart`, so a regression fails without
Node.js installed.

### Known divergences and limits

- `draft-disconnected` is the one fixture this port does not reproduce,
  because upstream is wrong there: the two-node shortcut in `spectral.js` adds
  the default function-valued `idealEdgeLength` to a coordinate without
  calling it, so every component of exactly two nodes comes back with a
  concatenated string and a `NaN`. This port computes the placement
  numerically instead.
- Randomized differential coverage of uncommon topology, overlapping
  alignment, and fixed-node combinations is still thinner than the rest.
- Component packing inherits layout-utilities' grid sizing, which scales with
  the square of the component count and inversely with node size. Many small
  components spread far apart can therefore ask for a grid too large to
  allocate; the packer refuses such input with an `ArgumentError` instead of
  attempting it. Raise `polyominoGridSizeFactor` or pack fewer components per
  run.
- Browser presentation concerns — animation, viewport fitting, event emission,
  Cytoscape collection adaptation — are intentionally outside a
  renderer-independent layout engine.

## What is implemented

**Spectral start.** Sampled deterministic initialization with greedy or random
sampling, power iteration, a JAMA singular value decomposition transcribed
from layout-base, and dummy connections that reach disconnected root and
nested-owner child components.

**Spring embedding.** Rectangle-clipped CoSE springs, overlap separation,
per-node repulsion over CoSE-clamped grid neighborhoods, gravity, cooling, and
convergence; same-owner leaf reduction with ten-tick staged regrowth and
post-growth cooling; optional `uniformNodeDimensions` center-distance forces.

**Compound graphs.** Bottom-up bounds with per-node Cytoscape-style padding
and a layout-wide fallback, live compound forces, nesting-aware edge lengths,
compound gravity, and label geometry.

**Disconnected components.** Component detection, original-center relocation,
layout-utilities-compatible randomized polyomino packing, and incremental POSE
packing for `randomize: false`.

**Tiling.** Area-ordered or caller-sorted zero-degree tiling with randomized
sibling grouping, ideal-row-width organization, bottom-up clearing and
repopulation of nested compounds, and run-scoped lazy padding resolvers.

**Constraints.** Transformed and displacement-relaxed fixed, alignment, and
DAG placement constraints, cose-base-compatible cross-axis alignment dummy
handling including fixed groups and deeply nested compounds, and axis-aware
gaps for omitted relative placements.

**Options.** Typed quality, step, sampling, force, geometry, tiling, packing,
and constraint options, including the `all`, `transformed`, `enforced`, and
`cose` pipeline stages and the draft-quality bypass of the CoSE pipeline.

`CHANGELOG.md` records each parity slice as it landed.

## Upstream mapping

| Dart concern | Upstream source |
| --- | --- |
| geometry, graph validation, components | `layout-base` |
| spring embedding, cooling, compound bounds | `cose-base` |
| spectral start, constraints, public options | `cytoscape-fcose` 2.2.0 |
| component packing | `cytoscape-layout-utilities` 1.1.1 |

The public API expresses these algorithms with Dart value types and enums
instead of reproducing Cytoscape.js collection and callback conventions.
